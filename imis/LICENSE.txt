1. This Software is owned by IMAGING SYSTEMS or its suppliers and is protected by 
   copyright law and international copyright treaty. Therefore, you must treat 
   this Software like any other copyrighted material (e.g., a book), except 
   that you may either make one copy of the Software solely for backup or 
   archival purposes or transfer the Software to a single hard disk provided 
   you keep the original solely for backup or archival purposes.
2. You may transfer the Software and documentation on a permanent basis provided 
   you retain no copies and the recipient agrees to the terms of the License 
   Agreement. Except as provided in the License Agreement, you may not transfer, 
   rent, lease, lend, copy, modify, translate, sublicense, time-share or 
   electronically transmit or receive the Software, media or documentation. 
   You acknowledge that the Software in source code form remains a confidential 
   trade secret of IMAGING SYSTEMS and/or its suppliers and therefore you agree not 
   to modify the Software or attempt to reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble 
   the Software, except and only to the extent that such activity is expressly 
   permitted by applicable law notwithstanding this limitation. 
3. Except with respect to the Redistributables, which are provided "as is,"

   of receipt. Any implied warranties on the Software are limited to ninety (90) 
   days. Some states/jurisdictions do not allow limitations on duration of an 
   implied warranty, so the above limitation may not apply to you.
4. IMAGING SYSTEMS is not responsible for any implicit, explicit, incidental or 
   consequential damages, including damages for loss of business profits, 
   business interruption, loss of business information or any other pecuniary 
   loss arising out of the use of or inability to use IMiS® software even if 
   IMAGING SYSTEMS has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
